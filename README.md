# Red Alert

## Project Description:

Red Alert is a notification system designed to keep users informed about critical news affecting their stock portfolio. In today's fast-paced market, staying updated on relevant information can be overwhelming with a flood of news from various sources. Red Alert streamlines this process by delivering timely notifications for important articles directly to users, eliminating the need for constant monitoring of multiple platforms.

## Key Features:

**Personalized Notifications:** Users receive notifications tailored to their specific stock portfolio, ensuring they stay informed about relevant news.
**AI/ML Integration:** Leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, Red Alert identifies and prioritizes news articles based on their potential impact on the user's investments.
**Efficient Information Delivery:** Red Alert minimizes information overload by delivering only the most critical news articles, allowing users to focus on key updates without sifting through countless irrelevant sources.
**MERN Stack:** The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable foundation for development.

## How It Works:

**User Profile Setup:** Users create a profile and input their stock portfolio details.
**AI Analysis:** Red Alert's AI algorithms continuously monitor news sources and analyze articles to identify those relevant to the user's portfolio.
**Notification Delivery:** When significant news is detected, Red Alert sends a notification to the user's preferred device, ensuring timely access to important information.

## Why Red Alert?

**Save Time:** No need to constantly monitor multiple news sources for updates.
**Stay Informed:** Receive timely notifications about critical news affecting your investments.
**Personalized Experience:** Tailored notifications ensure relevance to your specific stock portfolio.
